    "2": "Lorenzo loved llamas. He loved the way their necks stretched high and their ears pointed straight up. He loved their long eyelashes and their deep eyes. Lorenzo lived high in the Andes Mountains where it gets very cold.\nllamas camel-like animals that come from South America\nAndes Mountains a long, high mountain range in South America",
    "3": "Every morning Lorenzo would put on his wool sweater and wool socks. He would put on his chuyo to keep his head and ears warm. Then he would go outside and climb the slope to where the llamas grazed.",
    "4": "His family had eight llamas. Lorenzo loved them all. He watched as they ate. He watched as they ran and jumped in the grass. He stroked them and sang to them. He called each one by name, and they knew him well.",
    "5": "But there was one llama Lorenzo loved best of all. His name was Oro, which means “gold” in Spanish. His coat was fluffy and white with a touch of yellow. In the sun, it glittered like gold.",
    "6": "Lorenzo often took walks with Oro. Together they would walk up into the high mountain meadows. Lorenzo loved the bright wildflowers. Oro loved the fresh grass. Today as they walked, Lorenzo played his panpipe. The clear notes sailed on the wind. The baubles tied to Oro’s ears bounced to the music.",
    "7": "Today the wind was sharp and cold. Lorenzo decided to head home. “Vámanos, Oro, let’s go,” he called. Oro turned his head. He looked at Lorenzo. Then he looked up the hill. The grass was green. He was in the mood to play. He ran off in the other direction.",
    "8": "“Come here!” yelled Lorenzo. “I want to go home!” Oro didn’t stop. Lorenzo ran after him and fell hard. “Oww!” he cried. His ankle hurt! It hurt a lot! He tried to stand, but it hurt too much. Lorenzo sat on the rocky slope with tears in his eyes.",
    "9": "Oro came back down the hill. He could tell something was wrong. He walked in circles around Lorenzo, humming loudly. He nudged Lorenzo with the side of his head. He grunted and snorted. Finally he calmed down and stood still. Lorenzo was scared. The pain was getting worse. He knew it would be dark soon, and it would not be safe to walk. He would be stuck on the hillside all night in the cold.",
    "10": "Oro knelt down by Lorenzo’s side. He huddled close as the air got colder. His thick wool warmed Lorenzo’s cold face and hands. The sun was sinking fast. Lorenzo’s ankle was swollen. The pain was strong. He began to cry.",
    "11": "Suddenly Oro jumped up. He reached for the panpipe with his mouth and pulled it from Lorenzo’s hands. With a quick look back, away he ran. He ran straight to the adobe home where Lorenzo lived. Oro whined. He cried. He hissed. He spat.",
    "12": "Lorenzo’s mother opened the door. She looked at Oro. She looked at the panpipe in his mouth. She knew there was trouble. “Where’s Lorenzo, Oro?” she cried. “Take me to him! Hurry!”",
    "13": "Oro led the way. Together they ran up the hill to the place where Lorenzo waited. Lorenzo’s mother ran to him and helped him up. Lorenzo put one arm around her shoulder. He put the other arm around Oro’s neck. Step by step they made their way down the hill. Lorenzo’s mother bandaged his ankle, fed him some soup and potatoes, and put him to bed.",
    "14": "The next morning, Lorenzo took some string. He tied it to both ends of the panpipe. Then he hobbled outside and called for Oro Proudly, he hung the panpipe around Oro’s neck. “Gracias, Oro. Thank you,” he said, giving the llama a big hug. “You are worth far more than gold!”"
